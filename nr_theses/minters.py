    This is a minter specific for records.
    With the help of
    :class:`invenio_pidstore.providers.recordid.RecordIdProvider`, it creates
    the PID instance with `rec` as predefined `object_type`.

    Procedure followed: (we will use `control_number` as value of
    `PIDSTORE_nr_id_FIELD` for the simplicity of the documentation.)

    #. If a `control_number` field is already there, a `AssertionError`
    exception is raised.

    #. The provider is initialized with the help of
    :class:`invenio_pidstore.providers.recordid.RecordIdProvider`.
    It's called with default value 'rec' for `object_type` and `record_uuid`
    variable for `object_uuid`.

    #. The new `id_value` is stored inside `data` as `control_number` field.

    :param record_uuid: The record UUID.
    :param data: The record metadata.
    :returns: A fresh `invenio_pidstore.models.PersistentIdentifier` instance.
